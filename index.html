            <p>
              A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
              Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of
              experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2
              diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar
              content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
              strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes
              daily for five days a week.

          <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
          <p>
            Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is
            not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully
            consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement
            may not be beneficial to use.

            <h4>Gender</h4>
            <p>
              The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary
              with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered
              when evaluating their BMI.

            <h4>Age</h4>
            <p>
              In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause
              BMI to underestimate body fat content.

            <h4>Muscle</h4>
            <p>
              BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese,
              as it doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.

            <h4>Pregnancy</h4>
            <p>
              Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing
              baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to
              minimise health risks for both mother and child.

              Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and
              Asian origins at lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is
              advised to discuss this with your GP or practice nurse.
